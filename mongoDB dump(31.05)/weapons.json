Unlike its real-life counterpart, it is fully automatic. In-game the P10 RONI is functionally similar to the Mx4 Storm. They share the same weak single shot damage and high rate of fire. However, its smaller magazine size of 15+1 rounds means that the magazine empties even faster. To balance, the P10 RONI has the fastest tactical reload of all SMGs at only 1.7 seconds. The recoil is much lower than that of the Mx4 Storm, especially in the horizontal aspect, meaning it is very easy to manage.

  "overview": "A devastating handgun, each shot delivers a huge punch to any operators unlucky enough to be on its receiving end. Landing just two hits during CQC on all armor types are enough to kill them outright. The strong recoil and iron sights, however, limit its usage to close-range encounters. The weapon also has soft destruction capabilities and can be used to make small holes. This trait is especially useful to Valkyrie, who can establish lines of sight for her cameras. The Muzzle Brake is an extremely helpful attachment for the D-50, as it lowers the aggressive recoil kick by nearly half.",
