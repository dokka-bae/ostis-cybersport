  "deviceEvaluation": "<br>Device: Kiba Barrier</br><br>Operator:Specialist Kana 'Azami'</br><br>Evaluation Lead: Dr. Elena 'Mira' Álvarez, Director of R&D.</br>This sticky canister has been long overdue for a redesign. Collaborating with Azami on the updated version reminded me of why it was created in the first place. Sure, we have sturdier shields, but for mobility and versatility in a protective device? You can't get better than the Kiba Barrier.I had my doubts about weaponizing the casing, but Azami was persuasive. While deployment saves essential time, activating the wrist sheath requires precision. Mastering the maneuver requires paying close attention to your fingers. That is, if you're interested in keeping them. Compound L-7 and Solution K-13 remain under development, so l've been spending most of my time ensuring the phase transition from a gaseous to a solid state is stable. The resulting substance is bulletproof and can be deployed on almost any surface, providing quick cover when you need it. Though not blast resistant, the barrier can withstand limited melee assault. With its ability to quickly repair holes in walls and floors, the Kiba Barrier provides enough time to reach cover and assess the battlefield. I can't think of anything more appropriate for Azami than a device that literally pulls a shield from thin air. Quick thinking and creativity are your greatest allies when utilizing the Kiba Barrier.",

Finding chemicals with biocompatibility and bioabsorbable properties was critical to the success of the polyurethane foam capsules. The sensor combined with its 360 directional rotation allows the station to distribute the agent unassisted, enabling the operator to focus on other tasks and strategic placement. The Kona healing station is almost as good as having an extra member on the team. The addition of chitosan with the pressure from the expanding foam can seal a bigger wound than medical cyanoacrylate adhesives. I think Doc will be excited at the prospect of no longer needing to extract fibers from healing wounds.",

So here's what I know: once the Pest is deployed, it's programmed to search a specific area, latching onto the nearest enemy drone and obscuring the camera. Then it initiates the override sequence. Their drone now belongs to him. It happens fast. Even faster is Mozzie shooting the Pest directly at a drone.",

My first thought was something like a bull driver - ram right into 'em! But we needed something to disable them. We needed something to get them off our tail and give us some distance. I started with the classic road spike and transformed it into interconnected webbing. The hexagonal cluster of spikes is strong and covers uneven ground better than a straight mat. Once that was done, I adapted it until it was disc shaped. Not only did this make it easier to mount onto my truck, it meant that I could eject the traps while driving. Rainbow's engineering think tank suggested a portable ground version. That had me tinkering big time! There were a lot of variables to contend with: It became all about spring-loaded mechanisms, centrifugal force, and timing. I compressed the discs into a neat, little package, stacked them, and inserted a mechanism that requires some serious muscle to crank it up. Once it's deployed, they have no trouble covering a large area. Nothing is getting through.",
